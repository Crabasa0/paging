1. Change clock algorithm so it doesnt always start at index 0.
2. Update entries array when a page is swapped into MM.
	a. page number math: page_no = (real_addr - PT_AREA_SIZE) / PAGESIZE;
3. Make sure that if an lpt has block 0 in the first 20 bits and no dirty, referenced, or resident, it doesnt come up in vmsim as lpte == 0, allocating a new page and setting accordingly.
	a. Think- is this actually a problem? 
	b. possible fix: start at block 1 instead of block 0
4. Keep track of which lptes have gone to which blocks so that blocks can be reused
	a. dirty bit usage

Find out why search() is returning an lpte with real address 0.
